## Resume: 

This project consists of programming a C library using libc functions as a reference.

The library includes the functions of the following projects:
- [Libft](https://github.com/goldcod3/Libft)
- [Get_next_line](https://github.com/goldcod3/Get_next_line)
- [Ft_printf](https://github.com/goldcod3/Ft_printf)

## Compile Options:

```
$ make
```
The **make** rule will compile the whole library generating a static library 'libft.a' containing all the functions of the project.
```
$ make clean
```
The **clean** rule will delete all objects created to compile the library 'libft.a'.
```
$ make fclean
```
The **fclean** rule will delete all created objects and the 'libft.a' file that has been previously compiled.
```
$ make re
```
The **re** rule will remove all compiled objects and files (if any) and recompile the library.
